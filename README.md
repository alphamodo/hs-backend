# ðŸ§  HypeBot Runner (Puppeteer + Supabase)

This is the backend automation engine for the Hypebeast Drop Bot platform.

It polls tasks from Supabase, runs headless browser sessions using Puppeteer, checks for product availability, and auto-checks out limited-edition items. Task statuses and purchases are synced back to Supabase for real-time updates on the Lovable.dev frontend.
